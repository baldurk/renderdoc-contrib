# Where is my Draw?

This extension is primarily aimed at newcomers to graphics debugging who might not know where to get started debugging when a drawcall is completely missing. It can be a useful timesaver for anyone though. It will work through a series of checks to try to narrow down why a drawcall is missing.

If you find a case where a drawcall is missing and you feel like it's something this extension could usefully catch or alert you to then please file an issue with more information.

This extension is generally built against the latest version of RenderDoc, as the python API can change between versions and ease of readability is valued over backwards compatibility.
